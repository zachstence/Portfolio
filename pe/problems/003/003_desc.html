<p>I first solved this problem September 15th, 2014 in my AP Computer Science class in highschool. I do not have the original code I wrote, but I have redone the solution and included it below.</p><p>To solve this problem I first wrote a simple function to check whether a given number is prime or composite. It works by iterating through all possible divisors of a number, and if none divide it, it is prime. From there I iterate through numbers starting at the square root of 600851475143 and breaking at the first prime divisor.</p>
