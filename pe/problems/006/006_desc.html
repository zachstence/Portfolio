<p>I first solved this problem October 8th, 2014 in my AP Computer Science class in highschool. I do not have the original code I wrote, but I have redone the solution and included it below.</p>
<p>This problem is perhaps the easiest one yet on ProjectEuler. I just wrote two functions that return the sum of the squares and the square of the sum of the first <code>n</code> natural numbers (<code>sumOfSq</code> and <code>sqOfSum</code>, respectively). Then I just called them with 100 as the argument, and output the difference.</p>
