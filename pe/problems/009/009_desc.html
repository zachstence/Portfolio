<p>I first solved this problem May 22nd, 2015 in the summer after my junior year of highschool. I do not have the original var I wrote, but I have solved the problem again and included the code below.</p>
<p>I solved this problem with a simple brute force approach of looping through all possible numbers <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var> and printing the product <var>abc</var> if it satisfies <var>a</var><sup>2</sup> + <var>b</var><sup>2</sup> = <var>c</var><sup>2</sup> and <var>a</var> + <var>b</var> + <var>c</var> = 1000.
