<p>I first solved this problem October 1st, 2014 in my AP Computer Science class in highschool. I do not have the original code I wrote, but I have redone the solution and included it below.</p><p>I solved this problem by first writing a function to check whether or not a positive integer is a palindrome. The function first converts the integer to a string, then uses C++11 iterators to check to make sure each number starting at the front and back is equal. Then in main, I iterate through all possible products (starting at 999 * 999 to find the max sooner), and store the maximum palindrome.</p>
