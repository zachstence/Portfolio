<p>I first solved this problem October 8th, 2014 in my AP Computer Science class in highschool. I do not have the original code I wrote, but I have redone the solution and included it below.</p>
<p>For this problem, I reused the <code>isPrime</code> function I wrote for <a href="/?problem=3">Problem 3</a>and wrote a new function <code>findNextPrime</code> that takes an integer as a parameter and returns the net greatest prime number. Then in <code>main</code> I simply loop and generate prime numbers, keeping track of the number and its index, and stop when index reaches 10,001</p>
