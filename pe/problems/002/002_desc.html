<p>I first solved this problem September 2nd, 2014 in my AP Computer Science class in highschool. I do not have the original code I wrote, but I have redone the solution and included it below.</p>
<p>This problem was also fairly easy. I simply generated Fibonacci numbers until they reached four million, and added them to a sum if they were even. This code could also be optimized, but I prefer this simple version.</p>
