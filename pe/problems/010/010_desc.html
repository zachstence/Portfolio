<p>I first solved this problem May 27th, 2015 in the summer after my junior year of highschool. I do not have the original var I wrote, but I have solved the problem again and included the code below.</p>
<p>To solve this problem I simply used the same <code>isPrime</code> function I had previously written, looped through every number below 2 million, and added it to a sum if it was prime. Very brute force, but it works.</p>
