<p>I first solved this problem May 22nd, 2015 in the summer after my junior year of highschool. I do not have the original code I wrote, but I have solved the problem again (with a much nicer solution) and included the code below.</p>
<p>To solve this problem I first wrote a function <code>maxProduct</code> that finds the maximum product of a string of numbers of a certain length. It does so by first finding the product of the first 13 digits, and then updating the product by dividing by the first digit and multiplying by the next, effectively "shifting" the digits in the product down the entire string, all while keeping track of the max product encountered.</p>
<p>Now, we could just use a similar function and loop through the whole 1000-digit integer and get an answer, but that is quite inefficient and there is a really elegant way of limiting the number of products we have to check to find the maximum.</p>
<p>To vastly reduce the number of products we need to check we need to assume that the max product will be greater than 0 (this is a valid assumption as long as the 1000-digit string has at least one non-zero number, and by definition it must in order to be 1000-digits long). Since we are interested in the product of consecutive digits, and any number multiplied by 0 is 0, we know the maximum product can not contain a 0 in its string of 13 integers. With this knowledge, we find the answer by splitting the 1000-digit integer by the 0s, and checking those strings for their max product.</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> It is necessary to use <code>long long</code> rather than just <code>int</code> because the maximum a product could be is 9<sup>13</sup> = 2541865828329 &gt; 2<sup>15</sup> &ndash; 1 which is the rollover point for integers in C++</p>
