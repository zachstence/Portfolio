<p>I first solved this problem September 1st, 2014 in my AP Computer Science class in highschool. I do not have the original code I wrote, but I have redone the solution and included it below.</p>
<p>This is a very simple and classic problem, commonly referred to as the "Fizz-Buzz test" used in job interviews in order to weed out applicants. More optimization could be done to make the program run faster, but I prefer this very clear solution.</p>
