        <p>A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.<br>Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.</p>

        <p>I first solved this problem October 1st, 2014 in my AP Computer Science class in highschool. I do not have the original code I wrote, but I have redone the solution and included it below.</p>
 
        <p>I solved this problem by first writing a function to check whether or not a positive integer is a palindrome. The function first converts the integer to a string, then uses C++11 iterators to check to make sure each number starting at the front and back is equal. Then in main, I iterate through all possible products (starting at 999 * 999 to find the max sooner), and store the maximum palindrome.</p>
